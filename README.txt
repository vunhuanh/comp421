# Gourmet
Gourmet is an application which lets you reserve tables in our partnered restaurants, as well as buy event tickets and food.
We have opted to write a functional GUI interface using Python and TKinter. 
To run the application you will need:
-Python 2
-pip
-psycopg2
-sqlalchemy
-pandas.io.sql
Here are the options the user can choose from after registering with us:
-Log into their account
-View their points
-View upcoming reservation
-View upcoming pickup order
-View upcoming events
-Make a reservation
-Make a food pickup order
-Purchase tickets for an event
-Review a restaurant
-Check out their items in their cart
-Log out
Each of these options also have sub-options that can be accessed by running the application.
